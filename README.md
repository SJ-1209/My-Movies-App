**** MY MOVIES APP ***

Implemented this useful app "My Movies App" using two famous JavaScript libraries ReactJS and Redux. This movie app is a running example of React-Redux connection. Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps

We can add movies to our store , add them to our favourite list and can see a number of information about our movies
